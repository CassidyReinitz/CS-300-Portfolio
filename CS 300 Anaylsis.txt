Project One: Runtime and Memory Analysis

Assume n = number of courses in the input file.

Vector:
- Insert/search: O(n)
- Advantages: Simple to implement and sort
- Disadvantages: Slow lookup for individual courses

Hash Table:
- Insert/search: O(1) average
- Advantages: Very fast lookup by course number
- Disadvantages: Not naturally sorted

Binary Search Tree:
- Insert/search: O(log n) average
- Advantages: Maintains sorted order with efficient operations
- Disadvantages: Can degrade to O(n) in worst-case

Recommendation:
The binary search tree is the best overall choice because it combines sorted order with efficient lookups.
