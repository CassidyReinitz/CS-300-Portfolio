## Reflection

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In Project One, I analyzed the runtime and memory efficiency of different data structures used to store and access course information. In Project Two, I implemented a program that reads course data and sorts the courses in alphanumeric order.

### How did you approach the problem?

I began by understanding the requirements and selecting the appropriate data structure based on the needs of the program. I used concepts like binary search trees and sorting techniques to ensure efficiency in both storage and retrieval of data.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I encountered a few challenges related to file parsing and tree traversal. I overcame them by breaking down the logic, reviewing examples, and testing frequently. Reflecting on the output helped identify and fix issues quickly.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project taught me to consider efficiency and clarity in my software designs. It reminded me that the choice of data structures and algorithms can significantly affect a program’s performance and scalability. I also learned how to structure a program from input handling to clean output presentation.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I now prioritize clean, modular code and clear comments. I’ve learned to structure programs so that changes—like different sorting methods or input types—can be made with minimal disruption. These habits will make future collaboration and debugging easier.
